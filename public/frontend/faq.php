Animals are to be treated and cared for in an infirmary until they are fit for discharge. The animal sent for care and treatment to an infirmary cannot be released from such places unless the a veterinary officer issues the certificate of its fitness for discharge. The cost of transporting the animal to an infirmary and its maintenance and treatment in an infirmary has to be paid by the owner of the animal.

One of these duties includes having compassion for living creatures. So, the animal lover is protected under the Constitution.<br><br>Article 19 of the Constitution of India deals with the right to freedom, and with this freedom comes the right to profession, occupation, trade, and business. Therefore, it means that every citizen has the right to occupation, and if someone has taken care of animals as his occupation, it is legal, and he has every right to carry on with his occupation.<br><br>Article 21 of the Constitution of India states the right to personal life and liberty. This is a very vast right. If someone wants to feed and provide shelter to dogs, he is at liberty to do so. He has the same right to liberty that the law provides to every citizen of India.<br><br>Section 503 of the Indian Penal Code 1860 provides that intimidation is a criminal offence that is cognizable.

The court says that it is necessary to bring into the record that these individuals and families who adopt stray animals are doing a great service to humanity as they are acting in the aid and assistance of Municipal Authorities by providing these animals with food and shelter and also by getting them vaccinated and sterilized. Without the assistance of such persons, no local Municipal Authority can successfully carry out its ABC programme.<br><br>The Court has proceeded to say that the local police and the municipal authorities are under obligation not only to encourage such adoption but also to ensure protection to such persons who come forward to take care of these animals, specifically the community or neighbourhood dogs, so that they are not subjected to any kind of cruelty. Finally, the Court has said that every individual has the right to live his life in the manner he wants, and it is necessary that society and the community recognize it.</div>

Dogs are responsible for up to 99% of human rabies cases, however the virus can be transmitted from the bite of any rabid animal. Human rabies cases have occurred because of bites from cats, Monkeys, mongooses, jackals, foxes, wolves and other carnivorous animals. Many animals will become aggressive and bite when they have rabies, including horses and donkeys. In animals where biting is not common, such as cattle and buffalo, transmission can still occur through exposure to saliva. Care should be taken while examining sick animals that are salivating.<br><br>There is no evidence suggesting that Rabies is being transmitted by bat exposure in India.</div>

                                 The most common route of transmission is through the saliva of a rabid animal. However, the rabies virus has also been found, and could possibly be transmitted, through other bodily fluids such as tears, and nervous tissue. Rabies virus is not found in blood or faeces. There are no evidence-based reports of human rabies arising from consumption of milk, including breastmilk, or cooked meat. However, consuming the meat or milk of a rabid animal is strongly discouraged. Individuals or professionals who slaughter rabies-infected mammals and handle tissues of rabid animals may be at risk of contracting the virus through breaks in their skin. These individuals should use specialised personal protective equipment and consult infectious disease specialists if they suspect they have been exposed to rabies infected carcasses.

However, caregivers should be vigilant when looking after patients with rabies and avoid contact with their saliva and other excretions. Handwashing and good personal hygiene are of utmost importance when caring for patients with rabies. As per National Guideline people who have been exposed closely to the secretions of a patient with rabies may be offered PEP as a precautionary measure.

                                 Yes. Organs transplanted from rabid organ donors can transmit rabies to the organ recipient. Individuals with symptoms of encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) before death should therefore be excluded as organ donors. Human-to-human transmission has never been confirmed outside the organ transplantation situation.

                                 <div>Rabies PEP (Post Exposure Prophylaxis) is the emergency treatment given to a person who may have been exposed to rabies virus through a bite or scratch from an infected animal. Rabies PEP consists of the following steps:<br><br>Wound treatment: The wound should be washed and flushed with soap and water for at least 15 minutes and disinfected with an antiseptic as soon as possible after the exposure.<br><br>Rabies immunoglobulin: This is a human or animal-derived product that contains antibodies against rabies virus. It is given by injection around the wound site to prevent the virus from spreading to the nervous system. It should be given as soon as possible, preferably within 24 hours of exposure, and no later than 7 days after the first dose of vaccine.<br><br>Rabies vaccine: This is a safe and effective vaccine that stimulates the body’s immune system to produce its own antibodies against rabies virus. It is given by injection in the arm or leg, usually in a series of four/ five doses on days 0, 3, 7, 14 and 28 after exposure depending on route of administration.<br><br>Rabies PEP is very effective in preventing rabies if given correctly and promptly. All three steps are equally important.</div>

                                 Consuming meat from a rabid animal is strongly discouraged. Although no human cases have been documented following the consumption of uncooked meat from a rabid animal, butchering or eating a rabid animal may potentially transmit rabies. If an exposure occurs, PEP should be initiated. Cooked meat does not transmit rabies; however, it is not advisable to butcher or consume meat of any kind from an infected animal. The carcass should be buried or burned if possible, with advice from a veterinary professional.

                                 After entering the human body e.g. through an animal bite, the rabies virus enters the peripheral nervous system and migrates to the central nervous system (spinal cord and brain). The infected person exhibits behavioural changes and clinical signs when the virus reaches the brain. Clinical signs typically appear 2-3 months after a person has been infected. In exceptional cases, clinical signs can develop after a few days, or after more than six months, following an exposure.
